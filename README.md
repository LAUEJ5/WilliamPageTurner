Welcome 'Pooners! The following are the set up instructions.

1. First ensure that you are in a room with decent lighting and that you are running the program on a computer with a webcam.

2. Clone the repository to your local code editor or download and unzip the files and do the same.

3. Install the necessary python libraries by typing in the following command into your terminal:

   * pip install -r requirements.txt
   * No other libraries should need to be installed, but if an error is being thrown, please use pip commands to install the missing libraries.

4. Run the CVMagazineReader.py file.

   * Wait until the PDF window and the camera both display themselves.
   * With BOTH of your hands on screen, you can now flip through the Lampoon magazine. Clench your right hand into a TIGHT fist to turn the page right and clench your left to turn the page left.
